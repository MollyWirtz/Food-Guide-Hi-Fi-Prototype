# Food-Guide-Hi-Fi-Prototype
A high fidelity prototype to define ingredients in processed foods. 

# About the Food Guide
The Food Guide was created as a term long project for Human Computer Interactions (CS3041) to design, research, develop, and test a user interface of my creation. This repository contains the final high fidelity prototype of the Food Guide which was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goals of this project were to further web development skills, and learn about the process of UI development. 

# How to Use the Food Guide
This is a web application that can be launched by downloading this repository and opening home.html in a web browser. It is recommended that this application be used in Mozilla Firefox for best results, as that browser will properly display scrolling and cursor activity. Update pending for full functionality in Google Chrome and further testing on Microsoft Edge and Safari. Because this application is meant to simulate a mobile app, it is meant to be displayed as such in the browser. In the developer tools, select the Responsive Design Mode option, and choose iPhone 6/7/8 for optimal viewing. 

Please note that as this is a prototype, the application makes use of canned data and has limited functionality. 

# Thank you 
A special thank you to clipart.email for use of their open-source graphic, Wikipedia for the information provided on the ingredients, AllRecipes for the use of recipes, and Nathaniel Rutkowski for inspiration for this application.
